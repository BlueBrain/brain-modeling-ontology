# where only a float ~value~ in the config, with ~scope=PATHWAY~ the same value of 0.71 should be used for all synapses of a given ~pathway~ to which the config applies.

# * SBO MMB Synapse Types

# We use a hierarchical organization of synapse types. A ~synapse-type~ is based on a ~model-template~. A ~model-template~ should resolve to a ~.mod~ file. With a respect to a directory that is known, we can just use the name of the mechanism /i.e/ the filename without ~.mod~. The model-template provides the list of parameters that can be configured (a default value is always provided in the ~.mod~). The values of the parameters listed in a ~SynapseType~ config determine it's type. Each ~SynapseType~ will also correspond to a group of ~pathways~ according to rules set by the scientists. Using the ~SynapseType~ config template for [[*ProbAMPANMDA_EMS]] we will have the following ~SynapseTypes~,

# ** E1_PT
# We will define excitatory pathways' ~synapse-types~ using ~ProbAMPANMDA_EMS.mod~. These will apply at least to cortical synapses, and should generalize to excitatory pathways in other regions as well.
