Brain Modeling Ontology
***********************

This repository contains BBP ontologies and schemas as well as the pipeline synchronizing them in the knowledge graph
both in `staging <https://staging.nise.bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/studios/neurosciencegraph/datamodels/studios/https%3A%2F%2Fbbp-nexus.epfl.ch%2Fstaging%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdatamodels%2F_%2F11426556-b37b-4cea-bec7-07d31c187bae?workspaceId=https%3A%2F%2Fbbp-nexus.epfl.ch%2Fstaging%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdatamodels%2F_%2Fd26de976-4dc3-4c24-abd5-53fa94567c02&dashboardId=https%3A%2F%2Fbbp-nexus.epfl.ch%2Fstaging%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdatamodels%2F_%2F7b472868-1d87-4e3f-b908-f05744abac8f>`__
(upon merging a merging request) and `production <https://bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/web/studios/neurosciencegraph/datamodels/studios/https%3A%2F%2Fbbp.epfl.ch%2Fnexus%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdatamodels%2F_%2F2de426bc-c6a0-48aa-9f43-a78fb2eb48fd?workspaceId=https%3A%2F%2Fbbp.epfl.ch%2Fnexus%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdatamodels%2F_%2F07a95fb1-67d9-4ae3-ab23-97cb4e0bce1f&dashboardId=https%3A%2F%2Fbbp.epfl.ch%2Fnexus%2Fv1%2Fresources%2Fneurosciencegraph%2Fdatamodels%2F_%2F1d7c47ef-b4ce-4faf-b122-9454a49d073f>`__
(upon git tag).

The ontologies are managed from WebProtege and added (currently manually by DKE) in this repository for synchronization and release in the knowledge graph.
